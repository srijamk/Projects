# SchoolProject
Python work (since 7th grade)

.py files are all problems that I've solved with Python with algorithms that I have gained knowledge of over time.

Contains a few Java files; I switched to Java by the end and I used this folder to hold the files until I created a new one just for Java.

Some .py files are sorting algorithms, such as quick_sort.py, which I used in a school project in 8th grade. I compared the running times for each algorithm on seven different computers, and presented my research to a panel of judges at the Howard County Science Fair. I won 2nd place in the Computer Science category.
